# Migration Documentation Index

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for migrating the Statistical Tutor from the current Chainlit/OpenAI implementation to a modern PydanticAI + Gradio architecture.

## Migration Strategy: Gradio-First Approach
Based on the requirement for evaluation features and multi-tab interface, we've adopted a **Gradio-First** strategy that implements PydanticAI agents and Gradio UI in parallel, reducing total migration time from 5+ weeks to 4 weeks.

## Documentation Structure

## Quick Start Guide

### For Implementation
1. **Start Here**: Read [04-GRADIO_FIRST_MIGRATION.md](./04-GRADIO_FIRST_MIGRATION.md) for the recommended approach
2. **Technical Details**: Review [05-GRADIO_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](./05-GRADIO_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) for implementation specifics
3. **Timeline**: Follow [06-UPDATED_TIMELINE.md](./06-UPDATED_TIMELINE.md) for week-by-week execution

### For Research/Evaluation Features
1. **Feature Overview**: See [07-EVALUATION_FEATURES_SPEC.md](./07-EVALUATION_FEATURES_SPEC.md)
2. **Integration**: Check [05-GRADIO_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](./05-GRADIO_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) Section 2 for evaluation tab implementation

### For Architecture Understanding
1. **Current State**: Review [01-MIGRATION_SPEC.md](./01-MIGRATION_SPEC.md) for current architecture analysis
2. **Target State**: Study [02-NEW_ARCHITECTURE.md](./02-NEW_ARCHITECTURE.md) for PydanticAI architecture

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Gradio-First?
- **Faster Development**: 4 weeks vs 5+ weeks
- **Early Evaluation Features**: Week 3 vs Week 6+
- **Built-in Tab Support**: No custom UI development needed
- **Lower Risk**: Single implementation path vs dual migration

### Why PydanticAI?
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation throughout
- **Agent Coordination**: Built-in multi-agent workflows
- **Model Agnostic**: Easy to switch between AI providers
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean, testable architecture
- **Tool Integration**: Easy integration of external tools (literature database, fact-checking)

### Migration Benefits
- **40% Code Reduction**: Simplified architecture
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Better Testing**: Dependency injection enables mocking
- **Future-Proof**: Modern, extensible foundation

## Implementation Phases Summary

| Phase | Duration | Primary Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Week 1** | Foundation | Models + Basic UI | Working agents + 4-tab interface |
| **Week 2** | Integration | Chat + Agents | Complete tutoring session |
| **Week 3** | Evaluation | Analytics + Forms | Full evaluation system |
| **Week 4** | Polish | Production Ready | Deployment-ready application |

## Dependencies

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pydantic-ai>=0.0.14 gradio>=4.36.1 pydantic>=2.0.0 plotly>=5.0.0 pandas>=2.0.0
```

## Support & Maintenance

### Version Control
- Keep this index updated as documentation evolves
- Use semantic versioning for major architecture changes
- Tag releases corresponding to migration phases

### Documentation Updates
- Update specs when implementation deviates from plan
- Add lessons learned and implementation notes
- Maintain backward compatibility notes

## Next Steps
1. Review [04-GRADIO_FIRST_MIGRATION.md](./04-GRADIO_FIRST_MIGRATION.md) for immediate next steps
2. Set up development environment per [06-UPDATED_TIMELINE.md](./06-UPDATED_TIMELINE.md) Week 1
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation with foundation setup
